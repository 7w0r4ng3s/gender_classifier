gender classification challenge from Siraj Raval

Three machine learning classifiers are used to complete this gender classification challenge.

###Decision Tree Classifier

Decision tree classifier was the default classifier Siraj used in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU). Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method which predict the value of target variable by learning the decision rules from features.



### K-NN Classifier

K-NN classifier is among the simplest machine learning algorithm. Classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point.



### Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machines are a set of supervised learning methods used for [classification](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-classification), [regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-regression) and [outliers detection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-outlier-detection). 



### Multi-layer Perceptron classifier

This model optimizes the log-loss function using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent.
